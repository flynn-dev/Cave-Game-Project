# Cave-Game-Project
Video game I created with a group of three other people. The game was made in Unity using C#

This is a short platforming game called "Dreki's Way Home" It was worked on from October 2020 to November 2020.
I worked with a group of three other people on this project. I was the head game designer and sole programmer.

You may view the code I wrote in "Cava-Game-Project/Assets/Scripts".

To play the game, navigate to "Cave-Game-Project/Builds" and run "DrekisWayHome.exe".
