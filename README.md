# Cave-Game-Project


This is a short platforming game called "Dreki's Way Home" created as a final project for my Game Creation 12 class from October 2020 to November 2020.
I worked with a group of four people on this project. I was the head game designer and sole programmer on this project. 

You may view the code I wrote in "Cava-Game-Project/Assets/Scripts".

To play the game, navigate to "Cave-Game-Project/Builds" and run "DrekisWayHome.exe".
